  - 3b- (GitHub zip) unzip all files and "Backup" folder from **INSIDE** `zip\...main folder\` to the "Bin64" folder  
    IMPORTANT: the "Backup" folder is also NECESSARY for operation!
  - 4a - For Windows: run `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd` and press "**C**"(x2) to install CreamAPI
  - 4b - For Linux/OSX: run `CreamAPI_Linux` and press "**C**"(x2) to install CreamAPI

- 🗑️ ***Uninstall***:
  - For Windows: run `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd` and press "**R**"(x2) to delete all CreamAPI files.

    Note: Don't worry if the game has been updated in the meantime, it checks first ;)

- 🔄 ***If a game patch breaks the unlocker***:
  - Run `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd` or `CreamAPI_Linux` and press "**C**",  
    if it recognizes that CreamAPI is no longer present, press "**C**" a second time.  
    It is not necessary to download a new version of the unlocker when a game patch breaks CreamAPI,  
    just run the tool + "**C**"(x2).  
    However when a new DLC comes out you need the new unlocker version,  
    or just edit "cream_api.ini" accordingly, see "What I did to set up CreamAPI" at the end of this page.

- 💸 ***If you already own some DLC***:
  - You need to remove the lines corresponding to your owned DLCs, from the "cream_api.ini" file, so:
    - Follow the instructions for "Installation" first
    - In the game "Bin64" folder, open `cream_api.ini` with a text editor like notepad
    - Look below for the lines with the DLC codes and names
    - Remove the entire line(s) corresponding to the DLC(s) you already own
    - Save the file and backup it if you want
  - Now everything should work fine.
  - If you purchased a DLC but deactivated it from Steam, leave it in the list.  
    Example: the Deluxe DLC, in addition to unlocking an few skins, makes you download a few GB  
    of useless files related to a very old vanilla version of the game.  
    With this method you can unlock just the blocks, keeping the dlc deactivated from Steam  
    and therefore without downloading few GB of data (but losing dlc related skins).

- ⚠️ ***Troubleshooting***:

  - If your antivirus say something, make an exception for the "steam_api64.dll" file.  
    (it's safe, but software houses don't like it when you play their games for free)

  - If you get the "Windows protected your PC" message when you launch "CreamAPI_Tool.cmd":  
    please see [this thread](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker/discussions/40)

- 💡 ***How the new Tool works, newbies proof***:

  - Installer `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd + press C`:  
    The installer is used both to install CreamAPI and to check if everything is ok after a game update.  
    What does it do exactly? if CreamAPI is not yet present so in the case of a new installation or  
    after an update that replaces and updates the "steam_api64.dll" file,  
    it creates a backup of the new original file and installs/restores CreamAPI.  
    So, if the game gets updated, you don't even have to download a new version of the unlocker,  
    just run the Tool+C to restore CreamAPI.  
    If it detects that CreamAPI is present and ready, it does nothing.  
    The only time you need to update the unlocker is when a new DLC is released.

  - Remover `CreamAPI_Tool.cmd + press R`:  
    The remover first checks if the game has undergone an update that has already replaced  
    the "steam_api64.dll" file or if CreamAPI is still present,  
    then removes it accordingly, depending on the specific case.

  - The Tool works regardless of the game path,  
    i.e. if you have the game on "C:\", "E:\games", "Y:\folder\steam" etc., it works anyway.

- 📜 ***Notes***:

  - This unlocker is meant to unlock DLC blocks, so you can use them without paying for DLC.
    - Now using CreamAPI, configured for Space Engineers. The old method no longer works.
    - Anyway, Armor Skins and Emotes cannot be unlocked.
    - It is not possible to paste DLC items contained in projects when playing on a server.  
      But you can paste the corresponding ones of the dcls you purchased,  
      just check out at the above section: "***If you already own some DLC***".

  - I will update the unlocker if needed, or right after a new DLC release.
    - A new dlc requires editing cream_api.ini to add the [new dlc code](https://steamdb.info/app/244850/dlc).
    - If you want you can also add it by yourself, towards the end of the cream_api.ini file.
    - If you know how to, you can use [CreamInstaller](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller), compatible with a lot of games.

  - If you want to buy the game:
    - Space Engineers on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244850/Space_Engineers/)
    - Space Engineers on [CDKeys.com](https://www.cdkeys.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=space%20engineers)

- 🧊 If you want to play the **Frostbite "Scenario"**, you need some other files:  

  - [Frostbite Scenario unlocker](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space-Engineers-Frostbite-Scenario-Unlocker) (+ CreamAPI = definitely works)

- 🧰 What I did to set up CreamAPI:

    <details><summary>click to show</summary><p>

    ————————————————————————————————————————  

    - Downloaded CreamAPI from the [source page](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=70576) (cs.rin.ru)
    - Checked out the Space Engineers DLC on its [database page](https://steamdb.info/app/244850/dlc) (steamdb.info)
    - Edited the creamapi.ini file based on how the game works (dll and other stuff) and its DLCs
    - Opened the folder:
      `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`
    - Renamed the file "steam_api64.dll" to "steam_api64_o.dll" (it's required)
    - Placed here the CreamAPI files ("creamapi.ini" and the new "steam_api64.dll")
    - Started the game = all dlcs unlocked.
